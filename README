This is an artificial intelligence program to play Connect Four

It tries to find the best possible move for a chessboard of Connect Four with UCT algorithm. 

When the information of a chessboard is sent to the program, it builds the search tree, using Monte Carlo method in strategy.cpp.

Then it tries to find the optimal solution of the chessboard within the time limit and send the solution back to the Connect Four Game program.

This program can beat all my friends, and it has a winning percentage of 92% when compete with other AI programs proved by my teacher.
